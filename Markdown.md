
# Team CamShaJuan's Final Project


## Members: Cam, Shawn, & Juan


### Possible Ideas:
ATM - Current Balance/Withdraw/Deposit/Checking/Savings/Transfer/Card #/Pin/Account lock functionality


    
    
#### Description of Project:
We are designing an ATM used to conduct transaction associated with a user's bank account.
It will have the normal functions of an ATM, such as getting the current balance along with depositing/withdrawing
currency to their account. They will be able to transfer funds as well between their Checking/Savings accounts.
All functionality will be secure behind the customer's pin before any transactions are allowed. Pin lock functionality will be implemented
in the case of too many wrong login attempts.

Extra functionality of a SQL Database or Swing GUI may be implemented depending on the project timeline.
